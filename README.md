# Web Style Guide (react-components-lib)
Project purpose is a style guide of my own apps. Arised from my previous App "Transactions".

## How to run
Once project is checked out, run the following commands:
  npm install
  npm start

#### If you're using Windows
If *npm start* does not start the application, start app and api in separate terminals by running commands:
- npm run api (API will be serving CSS, SASS and React/JSX source code)
- npm run app

Unfortunately API upload handling does not work on windows environment yet.
